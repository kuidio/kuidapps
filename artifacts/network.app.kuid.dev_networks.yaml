                                  matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                                  map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                                  operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
